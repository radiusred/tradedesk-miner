//! Plan 02-03 Task 1 — DST spring-forward fixture (T-02-09).
//!
//! Closes one half of CACHE-04 success criterion 5's DST coverage: the 2024
//! London spring-forward transition. At `2024-03-31T01:00:00Z` UTC, London wall
//! clocks jump forward from `01:00 GMT` to `02:00 BST` — the wall-clock hour
//! between `01:00` and `02:00` local DOES NOT EXIST on that date.
//!
//! ## What this test proves
//!
//! Dukascopy timestamps are UTC throughout (02-RESEARCH.md §"CSV Schema"); the
//! wall-clock hour-skip is INVISIBLE in the UTC source data. The aggregator
//! works in UTC throughout (D2-11) — no `chrono-tz`, no localtime conversion
//! anywhere on the kernel hot path. The aggregator's output bars across the
//! transition therefore stay EVENLY SPACED in UTC, regardless of what wall
//! clocks were doing.
//!
//! A localtime leak (someone reaching for `chrono::Local`, a `chrono-tz`
//! lookup, or any other reactive timezone helper inside the kernel) would
//! manifest as a 60-minute jump between two consecutive 15m bars — the
//! `frame.ts_open_utc[i] - frame.ts_open_utc[i-1] == Duration::minutes(15)`
//! assertion would fail at the transition. That is the regression-gate
//! purpose of this file.
//!
//! ## Why integration (not unit)
//!
//! The PLAN.md scope mandates tests against the FROZEN `miner_core::*`
//! re-export surface — `use miner_core::{aggregate, ...}`, not
//! `use miner_core::aggregator::...`. The integration test target enforces
//! this by linking against the published crate surface only. The shared
//! `MockReader` substrate lives at `tests/aggregator_fixtures.rs` (owned by
//! Plan 02-02 Task 2) and is pulled in via `mod aggregator_fixtures;`.
