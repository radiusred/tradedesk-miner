//! Plan 02-03 Task 2 — DST fall-back fixture (T-02-09).
//!
//! Closes the other half of CACHE-04 success criterion 5's DST coverage: the
//! 2024 London fall-back transition. At `2024-10-27T01:00:00Z` UTC, London
//! wall clocks jump back from `02:00 BST` to `01:00 GMT` — the wall-clock
//! hour between `01:00 GMT` and `02:00 BST` is REPEATED on that date.
//!
//! ## What this test proves
//!
//! Same shape as `dst_spring_forward.rs`, opposite direction. Dukascopy
//! timestamps are UTC throughout, so the wall-clock hour-repeat is INVISIBLE
//! in the UTC source data. The aggregator works in UTC throughout (D2-11) —
//! the output bars across the transition stay evenly spaced in UTC, no
//! duplication, no double-counting of the "repeated" hour.
//!
//! A localtime leak that confused the wall-clock-repeated hour with two UTC
//! hours would manifest as duplicate `ts_open_utc` entries OR a zero-length
//! delta between consecutive bars. The
//! `frame.ts_open_utc[i] - frame.ts_open_utc[i-1] == tf.duration()`
//! assertion catches both classes.
//!
//! ## Why two files instead of one
//!
//! Spring-forward and fall-back exercise different mental-model failures:
//!   - spring-forward: off-by-one around "the missing wall-clock hour"
//!   - fall-back: duplicate-handling around "the repeated wall-clock hour"
//!
//! The aggregator is UTC-only so neither bug class applies — but separate
//! files let `cargo test` run them in parallel without serial deps, and a
//! future regression in either direction surfaces in the file named after
//! that direction.
